# Custom Shell (`my_shell`) and Factorial Program (`fact`)

This project consists of two programs:
1. **`my_shell`**: A custom shell that can execute system commands and custom programs.
2. **`fact`**: A standalone program to calculate the factorial of a given number.

## Features

### `my_shell`
- Simulates a basic command-line interface.
- Executes standard system commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, `gcc`).
- Executes custom executables, including the `fact` program.
- Includes a built-in `exit` command to quit the shell.

### `fact`
- Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.
- Handles invalid input gracefully (e.g., negative numbers or missing arguments).
